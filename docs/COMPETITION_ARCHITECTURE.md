# Agent Adventures - Competition Architecture

## Overview
Hybrid audience-judge competition system that conserves tokens while maximizing engagement through strategic use of audience polling for high-level decisions and AI judge panels for technical execution.

## Core Principle: Token Conservation Strategy

**AUDIENCE DECIDES** ‚Üí High-level creative direction (free)
**WINNER EXECUTES** ‚Üí Only winning agent spends major tokens
**JUDGE OPTIMIZES** ‚Üí Technical quality without audience cognitive load

---

## Competition Types & Token Strategy

### 1. GENRE SELECTION
**Process:**
- ü§ñ **Agents**: Generate 5 genre options (minimal tokens - 1 sentence each)
- üë• **Audience**: Vote via chat poll (zero tokens)
- üèÜ **Winner**: Winning agent gets story control for entire session

**Token Cost:** `LOW` - Only 5 short proposals

### 2. STORY PROGRESSION
**Process:**
- ü§ñ **Agents**: Create story direction summaries (minimal tokens - 1-2 sentences)
- üë• **Audience**: Vote on preferred direction (zero tokens)
- üèÜ **Winner**: Winning agent crafts full 3-5 min narrative + scene direction (major tokens)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Judge Panel**: Reviews technical execution only

**Token Cost:** `WINNER-ONLY` - Major tokens spent only by chosen agent

### 3. ASSET PLACEMENT
**Process:**
- ü§ñ **Agents**: Generate object/placement concepts (minimal tokens)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Judge Panel**: Evaluate spatial reasoning, collision avoidance, aesthetics
- üèÜ **Winner**: Execute MCP calls to Isaac Sim
- üë• **Audience**: See results, no voting needed

**Token Cost:** `JUDGE-EFFICIENT` - Technical evaluation, no audience cognitive load

### 4. CAMERA MOVEMENT
**Process:**
- ü§ñ **Agents**: Propose camera concepts (minimal tokens - "dramatic close-up", "sweeping overhead")
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Judge Panel**: Evaluate cinematic quality, technical feasibility
- üèÜ **Winner**: Execute camera positioning via MCP
- üë• **Audience**: Experience result, no voting burden

**Token Cost:** `JUDGE-EFFICIENT` - Technical cinematic decisions

## Workflow: Complete Story Segment

### Phase 1: Story Direction (AUDIENCE)
```
1. Current 3-5 min TTS segment ends at decision point
2. Agents compete ‚Üí 3 story direction summaries (15-25 words each)
   - Claude: "Investigate the mysterious cave sounds - could be treasure or danger"
   - Gemini: "Confront the village elder about the ancient map's true meaning"
   - GPT: "Follow the strange lights toward the forbidden forest edge"
3. Audience votes ‚Üí A, B, or C via chat poll (3-5 min voting period)
4. Winner announced with agent credit
```

### Phase 2: Story Crafting (WINNER ONLY)
```
1. Winning agent crafts full narrative (500-1000 words)
2. Creates scene direction for Isaac Sim
3. Generates TTS script with dramatic pacing
4. Submits asset placement requests
5. Submits camera movement sequence
```

### Phase 3: Technical Execution (JUDGE PANEL)
```
1. Judge panel evaluates:
   - Asset placement spatial reasoning
   - Camera movement cinematography
   - Scene coherence with story
2. Optimizes technical parameters
3. Approves MCP execution plan
4. Winner executes Isaac Sim changes
```

### Phase 4: Delivery & Next Cycle
```
1. TTS narrates winning story segment
2. Isaac Sim displays scene changes
3. New decision point reached ‚Üí return to Phase 1
```
