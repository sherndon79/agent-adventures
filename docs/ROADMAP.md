# Agent Adventures Roadmap

This document outlines the development roadmap for the Agent Adventures interactive streaming platform.

## Current Status

### âœ… Completed (Phase 0 - Foundation)
- **MCP Integration Layer**: WorldBuilder, WorldViewer, WorldSurveyor, WorldStreamer, WorldRecorder
- **Basic Scene Construction**: Batch creation, asset placement, primitive elements
- **Test Suite**: Comprehensive testing framework for all world* extensions
- **Validation System**: USD-based conflict detection and error handling
- **Isaac Sim Integration**: Docker containerization and HTTP API interfaces

### ðŸŽ¯ Current Focus (Phase 1 - Core Platform)
- **Streaming Platform Fundamentals**: Live video streaming infrastructure
- **Agent-to-World Communication**: Robust pipeline for AI agents to control Isaac Sim
- **Competition Workflow Management**: Story generation, scene creation, judging pipeline
- **Dashboard Interface**: Basic control and monitoring UI
- **Error Handling & Reliability**: Robust error handling across the full stack

## Future Development Phases

### Phase 2 - Agent Intelligence & Interactions
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Agents working together and competing
- **Advanced Scene Generation**: Complex world building and storytelling
- **Dynamic Story Adaptation**: Real-time story changes based on agent actions
- **Agent Personality Systems**: Distinct character traits and decision-making patterns

### Phase 3 - Viewer Experience Enhancement
- **Interactive Viewer Features**: Chat integration, real-time polls
- **Advanced Camera Controls**: Cinematic shots, dynamic framing
- **Audio Integration**: Spatial audio, agent voices, sound effects
- **Multi-Platform Streaming**: YouTube, Twitch, custom platform support

### Phase 4 - Intelligence & Learning Systems

#### Viewer Feedback Training System
**Objective**: Use viewer feedback to improve agent scene generation quality

**Components**:
- **Post-Story Voting System**
  - Scale appropriateness ratings (asset size relative to scene)
  - Spatial composition feedback (cluttered/sparse/balanced)
  - Aesthetic appeal scoring (visual quality)
  - Story relevance assessment (how well scenes match narrative)

- **Feedback Data Collection**
  ```json
  {
    "scene_id": "unique_scene_identifier",
    "timestamp": "2025-09-16T14:51:00Z",
    "elements": [
      {"type": "castle", "scale": [1,1,1], "position": [0,0,0]},
      {"type": "mug", "scale": [1,1,1], "position": [5,0,0.5]}
    ],
    "viewer_feedback": {
      "scale_rating": 2,        // 1-5 scale
      "composition": 4,         // 1-5 scale
      "aesthetic": 3,           // 1-5 scale
      "story_relevance": 5,     // 1-5 scale
      "overall": 3              // 1-5 scale
    },
    "viewer_comments": [
      "Mug too big, shadows the castle",
      "Love the castle design",
      "Scene fits the medieval story perfectly"
    ],
    "viewer_count": 1247,
    "engagement_metrics": {
      "vote_participation": 0.23,  // 23% of viewers voted
      "comment_rate": 0.08         // 8% left comments
    }
  }
  ```

- **Training Data Pipeline**
  - Real-time feedback collection during streams
  - Data preprocessing and quality filtering
  - Feature extraction from scene compositions
  - Model training infrastructure

- **Predictive Models**
  - **Asset Scale Recommendation**: Predict optimal asset sizes for scene context
  - **Spatial Composition Scoring**: Evaluate placement and spacing quality
  - **Aesthetic Quality Prediction**: Forecast viewer appeal of scene designs
  - **Story-Scene Relevance Matching**: Align visual elements with narrative themes

- **Agent Integration**
  - Pre-scene generation quality checks
  - Real-time composition optimization
  - Alternative scene suggestion algorithms
  - Continuous learning from viewer preferences

**Success Metrics**:
- Increased viewer satisfaction scores (target: >4.0/5.0 average)
- Reduced "bad composition" comments (target: <5% of feedback)
- Higher viewer engagement with scene voting (target: >30% participation)
- Improved agent scene generation consistency

### Phase 5 - Advanced Features
- **VR/AR Integration**: Immersive viewer experiences
- **Procedural World Generation**: Dynamic environments and locations
- **Advanced AI Reasoning**: Complex problem-solving and creativity
- **Community Features**: User-generated content, custom competitions

### Phase 6 - Scaling & Monetization
- **Performance Optimization**: Support for larger audiences
- **Revenue Models**: Subscriptions, sponsorships, premium features
- **Content Creator Tools**: Agent customization, story templates
- **Analytics & Insights**: Detailed performance and engagement metrics

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### Known Issues to Address
- **Queue-based Operation Reliability**: Extensions return "queue success" not "operation success"
- **Asset Scale Consistency**: No standard sizing across different asset types
- **Error Propagation**: Silent failures in some extension operations
- **Performance Optimization**: Scene complexity vs. real-time requirements

### Architecture Improvements
- **Async Operation Tracking**: Proper completion status for queued operations
- **Asset Metadata Standards**: Size, category, usage context information
- **Centralized Logging**: Unified error tracking and debugging
- **Load Testing**: Stress testing with complex scenes and multiple agents

## Contributing

This roadmap is a living document. As we complete milestones and learn from user feedback, priorities may shift.

**Current Priority**: Focus on Phase 1 core platform features before expanding into advanced functionality.

**Documentation**: Each major feature should include comprehensive documentation and testing.

**Feedback Loop**: Regular review of completed features and roadmap adjustments based on actual usage patterns.
